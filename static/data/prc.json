The rate of past-year medical visits due to a violence exposure was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.7%), equivalent to a point estimate of approximately 1.4 million children and youth. Of those with medical visits, 33.3% (95% CI, 23.1%-45.4%) were aged 2 to 9 years. Those with a past-year visit had higher levels of trauma symptoms (risk ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.44-2.03) adverse childhood experiences (risk ratio, 2.55; 95% CI, 2.34-2.78) and multiple violence exposures (risk ratio, 3.91; 95% CI, 3.22-4.76) compared with the general sample of children and youth.\nThe estimated large number of violence-related visits with medical professionals offers an opportunity to address a source of frequent injury, and provide counseling and referral for a high-risk segment of the population to treat and prevent further physical and mental health and social consequences.\nThe combined 2-survey sample consisted of 8503 children aged 2 to 17 years, 54.0% (95% CI, 51.9%-56.0%) aged 2 to 9 years, and 46.0% (95% CI, 44.0%-48.1%) aged 10 to 17 years; 51.2% (95% CI, 49.1%-53.2%) were male. The analysis of variables associated with a medical visit was conducted on the sample of 5187 children who reported a lifetime violence exposure, of whom 45.6% (95% CI, 43.1%-48.2%) were aged 2 to 9 years, and 54.4% (95% CI, 51.8% to 56.9%) were aged 10 to 17 years; 53.6% (95% CI, 51.0%-56.2%) were male.\nOut of the whole sample, 3.4% (95% CI, 2.6%-4.4%) of the children and youth had a violence-related medical visit at some time in their lives. The rate for such a medical visit for the past year was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.7%). Based on a US child and youth population of 73.75 million, the mean for the period 2011 to 2014, this would suggest a point estimate of approximately 1.4 million youth with violence-related medical visits for a 12-month period in that interval. Of those with medical visits, 33.3% (95% CI, 23.1%-45.4%) were aged 2 to 9 years.\nThe majority of the medical visits (71%) were for peer violence, and 23% were for sexual assaults. Parental child maltreatment composed 1% of the total. Sexual assaults by adults were the kind of exposure most often to result in a medical visit (20%) (Table 1). For all violence exposures, medical visits were less frequent in comparison with disclosures to police and teachers.\nChildren and youth with medical visits in the past year had higher than normal levels of general vulnerability, as indicated by adversity and symptom profiles. In the medical visit group, 28% had high levels of trauma symptoms, 87% had high adverse childhood experience scores, and 41% had unusually high levels of different kinds of violence exposures (poly-victimization).27 The risk ratio for these vulnerabilities in the medical visit group (in comparison with the other children in the sample) was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.44-2.03) for trauma symptoms, 2.55 (95% CI, 2.34-2.78) for high ACES, and 3.91 (95% CI, 3.22-4.76) for poly-victimization.\nAn estimated 1.4 million children and youth visited medical practitioners in the course of a year for help related to a violence exposure, according to this national survey. This is larger than estimates based on hospital ER visits, and likely reflects in part the reality that non-ER health settings receive considerable usage from violence-exposed children and youth. These non-ER settings may include urgent care facilities, private practices, and the offices of school health personnel. Whereas hospital ER studies generally focus on adolescents exposed to violence, perhaps assuming them to be the high-risk group, the present study revealed considerable use by children aged 2 to 9 years. It is important that studies of medical response to crime, violence, and abuse recognize the full developmental spectrum of exposures.\nIt should be kept in mind that the medical care visits represent a small portion of violence-exposed children and youth and also only a minority of those with injuries. But they include many of the most serious exposures and most vulnerable children\u2014sexual assaults, kidnappings, gang assaults, and aggravated assaults. They also disproportionately include children with high levels of previous violence exposure, children with many childhood adversities, and children manifesting mental health symptoms.", "site": "National Institutes of Health (.gov)", "sourceLink": "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingdecember2020", "sourceSection": "Comparing October to December 2020 with the same period the previous year, total offences were 9% lower (1.4 million)", "offence_type_map": "Overall Police Recorded Crime", "quality": "3.

Additionally, the CSI in Prince Edward Island had decreased the previous five\u00a0years before the increase in 2018.

Increases above the national average increase were reported in Prince Edward Island (+55%), Nova Scotia (+42%), Yukon (+20%) and Ontario (+18%). In all of these jurisdictions, the increase in sexual assault was either a large contributor to an increase in the Violent Crime Severity Index (VCSI), or a significant mitigator for decreases in the VCSI.\nOn January\u00a01, 2018, Statistics Canada, in collaboration with police, changed the definition of \u201cfounded\u201d criminal incidents.

For comparison, estimates for common assault without the change in reporting standards did not identify a noticeable change from the 2% increase in common assault reported in 2018.\nIn 2018, 11% of level\u00a01 sexual assaults reported to police were classified as unfounded, meaning it has been determined through police investigation that the incident reported did not occur, nor was it attempted. This represents a decrease from 14% in 2017 (Table\u00a02). In all, 3,633 incidents of level\u00a01 sexual assault reported to police in 2018 were deemed unfounded. More severe sexual assaults, where there was a weapon used or bodily harm, (level\u00a02 and 3) were less likely to be deemed unfounded (4% and 9%, respectively) than were level\u00a01 sexual assaults (11%). For comparison, 10% of common physical assaults (level\u00a01) were classified as unfounded in 2018, marking a decrease from 11% in 2017.\nAmong violent offences involving the use of a firearm that are specified in the Criminal Code, 43% in 2018 were the offence of pointing a firearm. Another 40% were discharging a firearm with intent and the remaining 17% were using a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence. Although the number of violent offences specific to firearms increased by a count of 43 in 2018 (from 2,766 in 2017 to 2,809), the rate remained stable due to an increase in population size (Table\u00a01). This stability followed three consecutive years of increases. While police reported a 10% decrease in the rate of using a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence (-43 incidents), and a 4% decrease in the rate of discharging a firearm with intent (-26 incidents), the rate of pointing of a firearm increased 9% (+112 incidents). The small change in the rate of these firearm-related offences in 2018 was largely the result of increases in the number of incidents in Quebec (+63 incidents of firearms offences), Ontario (+26) and New Brunswick (+24), and decreases in British Columbia (-60) and Saskatchewan (-36).\nThe rate of police-reported fraud (including identity theft and identity fraud) continued to increase for the seventh year in a row, with a 12% increase between 2017 and 2018, and marked a 46% increase over the rate reported a decade previously (Chart\u00a04; Table\u00a01).Note\u00a0  There were over 129,400 incidents of fraud reported by police in 2018, resulting in a rate of 349 per 100,000 population.Note\u00a0  Incidents of identity fraud and identity theft increased from 17,639 in 2017 to 19,584 in 2018, for a combined rate of 53 per 100,000 population in 2018. While fraud is not an especially severe crime in the CSI, it is a high volume crime which contributed to making fraud the primary driver for the increase in the overall CSI and the increase in the Non-violent CSI (NVCSI) in Canada.\nChart 4 start\nAccording to some police services, part of the increase in fraud was attributable to increased access for reporting fraud online. Additionally, certain types of scams have drawn the attention of the Canadian Anti-fraud Centre and the news media, particularly general online or telephone scams, such as the \u201cCanada Revenue Agency scam\u201d and pre-paid gift card scams (Breen 2018; CAFC 2019; Common and Vellani 2018; Crawford 2019; Whan 2018).\nPart of the year-over-year increase could be due to changes in the definition of founded when classifying reported incidents. Analysis of fraud incidents estimates that without the change in reporting standards, the increase in the rate of police-reported fraud in 2018 may have been between 10% and 11%, compared to the 12% increase reported in 2018 (see \u201cText box 2 and Survey description\u201d).\nThe combined rate of police-reported fraud (including identity theft and identity fraud) increased in all provinces and territories except for Yukon (-3%) in 2018. Notable increases in the rate of total fraud were reported in Nunavut (+36%), the Northwest Territories (+32%), Newfoundland and Labrador (+24%), New Brunswick (+24%), Manitoba (+18%), and Nova Scotia (+16%) (Table\u00a05). Since 2012, the rate of fraud has increased most years in all provinces and territories except Prince Edward Island and the Northwest Territories.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, 7 of Canada\u2019s 13 provinces and territories reported increases in their CSI. In order of magnitude, the provinces which reported increases were: Prince Edward Island (+17%), Ontario (+6%), Manitoba (+6%), New Brunswick (+4%) and Newfoundland and Labrador (+4%). Nunavut had a 6%\r\nincrease, and the Northwest Territories reported a 5% increase in their CSI (Table\u00a08).\nThe large increase in Prince Edward Island was driven by a 21% increase in the rate of breaking and entering and a 52% increase in the rate of sexual assault (level\u00a01), as well as a 17% increase in theft of $5,000 or under (non-shoplifting). Despite these increases, Prince Edward Island continued to report the lowest CSI among the provinces and territories.

According to several Canadian police services, as well as the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, the nature of extortion has been shifting in the digital world, including the use of hostage-taking scams, ransomware, sextortion and various other digital and electronic scams (CAFC 2019).\nExtortion was the second highest contributor to the increase in the national VCSI, behind sexual assault (level\u00a01). Among the provinces and territories, only Yukon and Nunavut did not report increases in the rate of extortion as they reported no incidents of extortion in 2018. The large majority of the increase in incidents of extortion in 2018 were due to increases in British Columbia (+463 incidents, +80% rate), Quebec (+358 incidents, +33% rate), Ontario (+306 incidents, +30% rate) and Alberta (+204 incidents, +52% rate). All of the CMAs except for Saguenay, Windsor, Sherbrooke, Saint John, and Peterborough reported increases in extortion in 2018. Vancouver and Montr\u00e9al reported the largest increases in incidents (+257 and +158, respectively).\nPhysical assault, like sexual assault, is classified by the Criminal Code and the majority fall into one of three separate levels depending on the nature and severity of the incident (see \u201cKey terminology and definitions\u201d for more detail on assault offences).\nPhysical assault continued to be the most prevalent form of police-reported violent crime in Canada in 2018, accounting for close to 6 in 10 (57%) violent offences.Note\u00a0 Police reported just under 240,500 assaults in 2018, over 8,500 more incidents than in 2017, marking a 2% increase in the rate of physical assault.

The increase in the rate of assault (level\u00a02) was largely due to increases in Ontario (+5%) and British Columbia (+4%). The rate of aggravated assault (level\u00a03) decreased by 3% nationally in 2018 (Table\u00a01).\nChart 19 end\nThe decline in the YCSI in 2018 was primarily the result of decreases in the rate of youth accused of breaking and entering (-25%), homicide (-30%), shoplifting of $5,000 or under (-17%), and robbery (-5%).

The rate of youth who were charged decreased by 7%\r\nin 2018 from 2017, while the rate of youth who were not charged decreased by 13% (Chart\u00a020).Note\u00a0 \nIn 2018, both the police-reported Crime Severity Index (CSI) and the crime rate increased 2%. This was the fourth consecutive annual increase in the CSI after 11\u00a0years of declines from 2004 and 2014.The majority of Canada\u2019s provinces and territories reported increases in their CSI, with the exception of Nova Scotia, Quebec, Saskatchewan and Yukon. Alberta and British Columbia experienced essentially no change in their CSIs. \nThe 2% increase in the national CSI between 2017 and 2018 was primarily the result of higher rates of police-reported incidents of fraud (+13%), sexual assault (level\u00a01) (+15%), as well as shoplifting of $5,000 or under (+14%) and theft over $5,000 (+15%). These increases were partially offset by a lower rate of police-reported incidents of breaking and entering (-1%) and robbery (-3%).\nPrior to legalized cannabis, only the rate of police-reported importation or exportation of cannabis rose above the previous year, while possession, trafficking and production fell.

Overall, total cannabis offences had been declining for six consecutive years prior to the decline in 2018. \nStarting October\u00a017, 2018 with the enactment of the Cannabis Act, police reported 1,454 incidents under the new legislation, which accounted for 4% of all cannabis-related drug offences despite the Act being in effect for approximately 20% of the 2018 calendar year. In the early months of enforcement, the most common types of offences under the Cannabis Act were related to possession (31% of all Cannabis Act offences), importation or exportation (21%), and sale (16%) (Table\u00a03). Four specific offences accounted for 62% of all Cannabis Act offences: \u201cimportation and exportation of cannabis\u201d (21% of Cannabis Act offences), \u201cpossession of illicit or over 30 grams of dried cannabis (or equivalent) by an adult\u201d (18%), \u201cpossession of over 5 grams of dried cannabis (or equivalent) by youth\u201d (12%), and \u201cpossession of cannabis for the purpose of selling\u201d (10%). In comparison, under the CDSA legislation, possession accounted for 78% of all cannabis offences in 2017 and 76% of CDSA cannabis offences in 2018. Due to legalization under the Cannabis Act, possession is only illegal under certain circumstances.\nIn 2018, there were 2,490 opioid-related offences in Canada, a rate of 7 incidents per 100,000 population (Table\u00a03). Among the provinces, the highest rates were reported in British Columbia (21 per 100,000 population), Alberta (11) and Ontario (5) (Table\u00a04).The CMAs with the highest rates of opioid-related offences were Kelowna (101), Lethbridge (84), Abbotsford-Mission (19), Vancouver (19) and Brantford (19). \nThe rate of heroin-related drug offences remained stable in 2018 after having recorded eight consecutive years of increases.

British Columbia accounted for 49% of all heroin-related offences in 2018; however, a 14% decrease in that province mitigated essentially all increases in other jurisdictions.\nTrends in police-reported drug offences in Canada may be related to varying policies, practices and resources available across different police services and over time. Comparisons between police services or between geographical areas should therefore be made with caution.\nThe Criminal Code specifies a number of violent offences involving the use of a firearm, including discharging a firearm with intent, pointing a firearm and using a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence.Note\u00a0  More serious crimes, however, such as homicide, robbery, assault and sexual assault, may have also involved a firearm. To measure all violent firearm-related crime, information on the incident characteristics must be used. In 2018, there were 7,477 violent crimes where a firearm was present during the commission of the offence, or a rate of 27 per 100,000 population.Note\u00a0  This marks a decrease of 5%, the first after four\u00a0years of consecutive increases. \nAmong violent offences involving the use of a firearm that are specified in the Criminal Code, 43% in 2018 were the offence of pointing a firearm. Another 40% were discharging a firearm with intent and the remaining 17% were using a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence.

We estimated the avoidable mortality associated with long-term exposure to tropospheric O3 in 14 cities in Mexico using information for 2015. The economic valuation of avoidable deaths related to SOMO35 exposure was performed using the willingness to pay (WTP) and human capital (HC) approaches. We estimated that 627 deaths (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 227\u20131051) from respiratory diseases associated with the exposure to O3 would have been avoided in people over 30 years in the study area, which confirms the public health impacts of ambient air pollution. The avoidable deaths account for almost 1400 million USD under the WTP approach, whilst the HC method yielded a lost productivity estimate of 29.7 million USD due to premature deaths. Our findings represent the first evidence of the health impacts of O3 exposure in Mexico, using SOMO35 metrics.", "We estimated that 627 (9% UI: 227\u20131051) deaths from respiratory diseases associated with exposure to O3 would be avoided in people over 30 years in the study area\u2014this represents 4% of the total deaths in the study area for the same cause and age group.

The avoidable deaths for respiratory diseases associated with O3 exposure amount to 627 deaths in the study area, which confirms the public health impacts of ambient air pollution.", "For 2015, the GBD estimated more than 1991 deaths (888\u20133247) attributable to environmental exposure to O3 for Mexico while we estimated 627 deaths. There are important differences between both studies such as the study area, the metrics of the exposure, and the causes of mortality. Our study is based on measurements from monitoring stations in 14 cities, uses the SOMO35 metric, and considers only deaths from respiratory diseases. Meanwhile, the GBD is based on chemical transport models for the entire country, uses the running 3-month (summer) mean of O3 concentration (of daily 1 h maximum values) as the metric of exposure, and selects the maximum of these values for each 0.1 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 (\u223c11 km \u00d7 11 km) over 1 year. Furthermore, the GDB considers only Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as a specific cause for analysis. The GBD results are higher because of these differences.", "In Mexico, a previous study called the \u201cCentral Region Study\u201d quantified the avoidable deaths attributable to O3 exposure using a different approach [39]. It included seven states, with a population of 25 million inhabitants, and most of the cities with high O3 concentrations in Mexico. This study reports a total of 1067 avoidable deaths in contrast to our estimate of 627 deaths. Once more, the metrics to evaluate O3 exposure play an important role. The \u201cCentral Region Study\u201d uses an annual O3 average concentration which is calculated from the maximum 8-h moving O3 averages, and a counterfactual scenario of 50 ppb. We used the SOMO35 indicator which is an optimal alternative to estimate chronic exposure; it uses the information from every day with moderate and constantly high O3 concentrations and not only the days with very high concentrations. In general, studies using different approaches from SOMO35 tend to overestimate the attributable deaths. ", "To contrast our results with different cut points, we used SOMO50 and SOMO0. The deaths attributable to respiratory diseases associated with exposure to O3 were estimated using the SOMO50 (exceeds of 50 ppb). The avoidable deaths attributable to O3 exposure decreased from 627 to 275 deaths, which is almost a 50% difference. The opposite extreme implies estimating avoidable deaths without considering a background concentration and without removing any excess, which is known as SOMO0. Under this consideration, the avoidable deaths attributable to O3 exposure would increase to 994. This difference reveals the importance of selecting the exposure metric and its counterfactual value when generating impact estimates. In September 2021, the WHO released new air quality guidelines (WHO-AQG), specifying 60 ug/m3 (30 ppb) as the limit value for O3 long-term exposure; using this concentration as a cut-off point, we observe that 782 deaths could have been avoided in 2015. It means that health impacts of this cut-off would be greater since, on average, 150 additional deaths would be avoided, compared to the estimates using 70 ug/m3 as the cut-off point."], "sections": "The data presented in this study are openly available in Harvard Dataverse at (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PXVSHA (accessed on 21 October 2021).\nHealth effects related to exposure to air pollution such as ozone (O3) have been documented. The World Health Organization has recommended the use of the Sum of O3 Means Over 35 ppb (SOMO35) to perform Health Impact Assessments (HIA) for long-term exposure to O3. We estimated the avoidable mortality associated with long-term exposure to tropospheric O3 in 14 cities in Mexico using information for 2015. The economic valuation of avoidable deaths related to SOMO35 exposure was performed using the willingness to pay (WTP) and human capital (HC) approaches. We estimated that 627 deaths (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 227\u20131051) from respiratory diseases associated with the exposure to O3 would have been avoided in people over 30 years in the study area, which confirms the public health impacts of ambient air pollution. The avoidable deaths account for almost 1400 million USD under the WTP approach, whilst the HC method yielded a lost productivity estimate of 29.7 million USD due to premature deaths. Our findings represent the first evidence of the health impacts of O3 exposure in Mexico, using SOMO35 metrics.\nAir pollution is considered to be one of the main environmental risks to health around the world [1]. Several studies have documented the association between harmful effects on human health and exposure to air pollutants [2,3], among them ozone (O3).\nFor 2015, it was possible to collect the information from 117 monitoring stations; however, only 59 (50.4%) met the criterion of a 75% sufficiency of data. Regarding O3 concentration, the municipalities of the metropolitan area of the Valle de Mexico, Le\u00f3n, Celaya, and Irapuato presented the highest concentration considering the SOMO35 indicator (Table 1).\nWe estimated that 627 (9% UI: 227\u20131051) deaths from respiratory diseases associated with exposure to O3 would be avoided in people over 30 years in the study area\u2014this represents 4% of the total deaths in the study area for the same cause and age group. The metropolitan area of the Valle de Mexico had the greatest impact, with 461 avoidable deaths (Table 2); Mexico City alone accounts for 66% of this total and exceeds the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, which occupies the second position.\nAnnual avoidable deaths from respiratory diseases associated with exposure to O3, 2015 a.\nAvoidable deaths account for almost 1400 million USD under the WTP approach, whilst the HC methods yielded a lost productivity estimate of 29.7 million USD caused by premature deaths and the central (point) estimates. Table S1 shows the productivity lost by city and age.\nThis study represents the first quantification of the health impacts attributable to long-term O3 exposure in Mexican cities using the indicator recommended by the World Health Organization (SOMO35). The avoidable deaths for respiratory diseases associated with O3 exposure amount to 627 deaths in the study area, which confirms the public health impacts of ambient air pollution.\nSOMO35 levels vary between metropolitan areas, but the MCMA, the most populated city, stands out with the highest concentration and contribution to the estimates of avoidable deaths. It is important to mention that the meteorological conditions in this region, along with the presence of precursor emissions, promote the formation of O3 during half of the year. However, although some cities have relatively high O3 concentrations, such as Salamanca, they did not represent a high contribution to avoidable deaths.\nSo far, the metrics used to evaluate the health effects associated with O3 exposure are primarily acute (1 h or 8 h moving averages), and studies of long-term exposure to O3 are based on the annual or warm season average of daily 8 h maximum concentrations [13,36]. This approach implies the use of higher concentrations compared to SOMO35, which is an indicator of the accumulated O3 concentration in excess of 35 ppb (70 \u03bcg/m3) during the whole year. The difference between these approaches represents a significant element in estimating deaths attributable to O3 exposure. Moreover, SOMO35 is a useful indicator for quantifying the health impacts of long-term exposure to O3 and a reliable procedure for estimating mortality attributable to O3 [37]; it has been used by the international scientific community [19,38], and therefore our results are likely to be highly reliable.\nFor 2015, the GBD estimated more than 1991 deaths (888\u20133247) attributable to environmental exposure to O3 for Mexico while we estimated 627 deaths. There are important differences between both studies such as the study area, the metrics of the exposure, and the causes of mortality. Our study is based on measurements from monitoring stations in 14 cities, uses the SOMO35 metric, and considers only deaths from respiratory diseases. Meanwhile, the GBD is based on chemical transport models for the entire country, uses the running 3-month (summer) mean of O3 concentration (of daily 1 h maximum values) as the metric of exposure, and selects the maximum of these values for each 0.1 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 (\u223c11 km \u00d7 11 km) over 1 year. Furthermore, the GDB considers only Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as a specific cause for analysis. The GBD results are higher because of these differences.\nIn Mexico, a previous study called the \u201cCentral Region Study\u201d quantified the avoidable deaths attributable to O3 exposure using a different approach [39]. It included seven states, with a population of 25 million inhabitants, and most of the cities with high O3 concentrations in Mexico. This study reports a total of 1067 avoidable deaths in contrast to our estimate of 627 deaths. Once more, the metrics to evaluate O3 exposure play an important role. The \u201cCentral Region Study\u201d uses an annual O3 average concentration which is calculated from the maximum 8-h moving O3 averages, and a counterfactual scenario of 50 ppb. We used the SOMO35 indicator which is an optimal alternative to estimate chronic exposure; it uses the information from every day with moderate and constantly high O3 concentrations and not only the days with very high concentrations. In general, studies using different approaches from SOMO35 tend to overestimate the attributable deaths. \nFor 2015, the GBD estimated more than 1991 deaths (888\u20133247) attributable to environmental exposure to O3 for Mexico while we estimated 627 deaths.

Police-reported data show that women are overrepresented among those who experience IPV, including among victims of intimate partner homicides. As is the case with many forms of violence, those who experience IPV often do not to report it to the police for a variety of reasons, including: fear of stigma/shame,Footnote 9 the belief that abuse is a private matter,Footnote 10 fear of court system intervention, or lack of trust in the criminal justice system.Footnote 11\nHere are some key facts:\nPolice-reported dataFootnote 12(2019):\n\nIn Canada in 2019, of the 107,810 people aged 15 and over who experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) 79% were women.Footnote 13\nAs in previous years, 2019 rates of IPV were more than 3.5 times higher among women than among men (536 versus 149 per 100,000 population).Footnote 13\n\nSelf-reported dataFootnote 14 (2018):\n\nOverall, 44% of women who had ever been in an intimate partner relationship\u2014or about 6.2 million women aged 15 and over \u2014reported experiencing some kind of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse in the context of an intimate relationship in their lifetime (since the age of 15). More specifically, women were significantly more likely than men to have experienced any form of IPV, including physical abuse (23% versus 17%, respectively), sexual abuse (12% versus 2%), and psychological abuse (43% versus 35%).Footnote 15\nWomen, relative to men, were considerably more likely to have experienced the most severe forms of IPV in their lifetime (since the age of 15): being made to perform sex acts they did not want to perform (8% versus 1%), being confined or locked in a room or other space (3% versus 0.5%), being forced to have sex (10% versus 2%), being choked (7% versus 1%), and having harm or threats of harm directed towards their pets (4% versus 0.8%).Footnote 15\nAmong people who experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime (since the age of 15), women are about four time more likely than men (37% versus 9%, respectively) to have ever been afraid of a partner. 55% of women who experienced physical or sexual IPV feared a partner at some point. Being afraid of a partner can indicate intimate partner violence that is more coercive, more severe, and more likely to reflect a pattern of abusive behaviours.Footnote 15\nWomen who have experienced  physical or sexual abuse before the age of 15 were about twice as likely as women with no such history to have experienced IPV either since age 15 (67% versus 35%) or in the past 12 months (18% versus 10%).Footnote 15\nAmong people who experienced IPV in the 12 months preceding the survey, women were twice as likely as men to have experienced at least one form of IPV on a daily or almost daily basis (12% versus 6%, respectively).Footnote 15\nThree in ten (29%) women 15 to 24 years of age reported having experienced at least one incident of IPV in the 12 months preceding the survey, more than double the proportion found among women between the ages of 25 to 34 or 35 to 44, and close to six times higher than that among women 65 years of age or older.Footnote 15\n\nYoung women (aged 15 to 24 years)\n\nAmong young women who reported ever being in an intimate partner relationship, almost three in ten (29%) of those aged 15-24 years experienced some form of IPV in the 12 months preceding the survey.

Being afraid of a partner can indicate intimate partner violence that is more coercive, more severe, and more likely to reflect a pattern of abusive behaviours.Footnote 15\nWomen who have experienced  physical or sexual abuse before the age of 15 were about twice as likely as women with no such history to have experienced IPV either since age 15 (67% versus 35%) or in the past 12 months (18% versus 10%).Footnote 15\nAmong people who experienced IPV in the 12 months preceding the survey, women were twice as likely as men to have experienced at least one form of IPV on a daily or almost daily basis (12% versus 6%, respectively).Footnote 15\nThree in ten (29%) women 15 to 24 years of age reported having experienced at least one incident of IPV in the 12 months preceding the survey, more than double the proportion found among women between the ages of 25 to 34 or 35 to 44, and close to six times higher than that among women 65 years of age or older.Footnote 15\n\nYoung women (aged 15 to 24 years)\n\nAmong young women who reported ever being in an intimate partner relationship, almost three in ten (29%) of those aged 15-24 years experienced some form of IPV in the 12 months preceding the survey. This proportion was much higher than that observed among women aged 25 years and older (10%).Footnote 16\nYoung women were five times more likely than women aged 25 years and older to have been sexually assaulted (5% versus 1% respectively), three times more likely to have been physically assaulted (6% and 2%, respectively), and almost three times more likely to have been emotionally, financially or psychologically abused by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months preceding the survey (28% versus 10%).Footnote 16\n\nIndigenous women\n\nIndigenous women (61%) in Canada were more likely to have ever experienced IPV in their lifetime (since the age of 15) when compared with non-Indigenous women (44%).Footnote 17\nIn the 12 months preceding the survey, 1 in 6 (17%) Indigenous women experienced at least one form of IPV\u2014psychological, physical or sexual\u2014compared with 12% of non-Indigenous women.Footnote 17\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual and people of a sexual orientation that is not heterosexual (LGB+) women\n\nOverall, 67% of LGB+ women who had ever been in an intimate partner relationship had experienced at least one type of IPV since the age of 15, compare to 44% among heterosexual women.Footnote 18\nAlmost half (49%) of LGB+ women indicated that they had been physically or sexually assaulted by an intimate partner since the age of 15, almost double what was indicated by heterosexual women (25%)Footnote 18\nOne in five (20%) LGB+ women had indicated that they had experienced some forms of IPV within the past year, almost twice what was said by heterosexual women (12%).Footnote 18\n\nWomen living with disabilities\n\nAmong people who had ever been in an intimate partner relationship, more than half (55%) of women with disabilities reported experiencing some form of IPV in their lifetime (since the age of 15), compared to 37% of women without disabilitiesFootnote 19\nIn the 12 months preceding the survey, 16% of women with disabilities experienced some form of IPV, compared to 10% of women without disabilitiesFootnote 19\nAmong LGBTQ2 (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Two-Spirit) women with disabilities, almost seven in ten (71%) experienced some form of intimate partner violence since the age of 15.Footnote 19\n\nVisible minority women\n\nAmong those who had ever been in an intimate partner relationship, 29% of women belonging to an ethno-cultural group designated as a visible minority reported experiencing some kind of psychological, physical, or sexual violence committed by an intimate partner in their lifetime (since the age of 15)Footnote 20\nVisible minority women and non-visible minority women were equally likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in the form of physical abuse (both 2%) or sexual abuse (both 1%) in the past 12 months.Footnote 20\nOne-quarter (25%) of visible minority women between the ages of 15 and 24 experienced IPV in the past 12 months.Footnote 20\n\nIntimate partner homicide\n\nBetween 2014 and 2019, there were 497 victims of intimate partner homicide, and\u2014similar to intimate partner violence in general\u201480% (400 victims) were women.Footnote 13\nWhile Indigenous women account for about 5% of all women in Canada, they accounted for 21% Footnote 21of all women killed by an intimate partner between 2014 and 2019 (83 victims). In 2020, 53 women, 11 of whom were Indigenous, were killed by their partner in Canada.Footnote 22\n\nResources\nYou may access the following list of additional support services for people affected by GBV.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada\u2019s Stop Family Violence website is a one-stop source of information on family violence and has resources and information for anyone experiencing family violence.\nJustice Canada\u2019s Victim Services Directory helps service providers, victims and individuals locate services for victims of crime across Canada.\n\n\nThis fact sheet was developed\u00a0in collaboration with other federal government departments.\nPublication date: fall\u00a02020.

I first asked an Oral Question in the House of Lords on 3 October 2011 \u2013 almost 10 years ago - arguing the case for cashless transactions and the necessity of amending the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964. As some of you may know, I have a long association with Britain\u2019s railways, and I was particularly motivated then by cable theft which caused thousands of hours of delay to train services.\n\nI said that ACPO reckoned that the cost to the United Kingdom economy in 2010 of this crime was something in the order of \u00a3770 million and that the problem was getting worse with the rise in the price of scrap metal. I argued that the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964 was out of date and that it needed to be replaced by new legislation that increased maximum penalties, eliminated the payment of cash as a means of settling transactions and moved to a system of licensing in place of the registration that then existed.\n  \nThe Home Office minister who replied \u2013 Lord Henley \u2013 said, and I quote:\n  \n\u201cThe noble Lord is right to point to the problems of metal theft. There is not just the direct cost but the cost to the transport industry, to the power transmission industry and to others. We will look at all possible changes that we can make. The noble Lord is right to draw attention to the 1964 Act and possible changes to bring in a cashless model. Whether that would necessarily improve matters needs looking at, but it would certainly improve the traceability of metals and might make it harder for criminals to dispose of them for cash.\u201d\n\nThe subject came up again in the Lords just five weeks later, on 10 November, when we had a debate on Remembrance Day.  A number of us spoke about the despicable theft of war memorials for their scrap metal value.  I said \u201cThe situation is now almost out of control. The increase in the world price of scrap metal, particularly copper, has made it a lucrative crime. It is also one that it is easy to get away with, mainly because of the inadequacies of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964. The absence of a proper licensing system for dealers, the use of cash to settle transactions and the imposition of absurdly low penalties for breaches of the law have all combined to produce the present epidemic of crime.\u201d\nOn the desecration of war memorials I quoted Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s comment at Question Time in the Commons the week, when he  described it as,\n  \n\u201can absolutely sickening and disgusting crime\u201d.\n  \nI went on to say:\n  \n\u201cIn an article in the Daily Telegraph on Monday this week, the Mayor of London wrote about how the plaques on a war memorial in Sidcup commemorating the deaths of 342 in both world wars, including that of Lieutenant George Cairns, who won the Victoria Cross in an act of extraordinary bravery in the Burma campaign in 1944, had been, in Boris Johnson\u2019s words,\n\n\u201cbrutally jemmied off and sold for scrap\u201d.\n\nBy then it was clear that the government was taking the issue seriously.  On 29 November 2011 they set up the National Metal Theft Taskforce that received funding of \u00a35 million for extra operational activity to tackle metal theft. \n\u2003\nThe lead in this was taken by the British Transport Police, which set up a central team to manage the programme and provide dedicated co-ordination and support in each region of the country. The taskforce programme financially supported the pilot of Operation Tornado, led brilliantly by the BTP, and the implementation of Tornado tactics by forces and agencies across the country. This was an enhanced identification initiative agreed by the British Metals Recycling Association and the police. Of the forces providing figures, 72% of yards signed up to Operation Tornado.\n\nIt had an immediate effect on metal theft. The British Transport Police told me that there was a decrease in reported metal theft of 52%. That was particularly good news for Network Rail, as it has led to a reduction of 59% in the total amount of delay minutes and reduced the company\u2019s compensation payments by \u00a35.6 million. \n\nI was told that the Ecclesiastical Insurance company had reported that the number of claims for theft of metal from church buildings had fallen sharply.\n\nIf we compared the national average reductions achieved in reported metal crime, then 38%, with the figures in the Deloitte report in 2011 in which they said that metal theft costs the UK economy \u00a3220 million to \u00a3260 million a year, then it is likely that the \u00a35 million taskforce money had delivered harm reduction for the UK of between \u00a383 million and \u00a398 million. That is a pretty good rate of return, as a relatively small investment of public money seems to have led to a substantial reduction in metal theft. \n\nTo make these improvements permanent we needed changes in the law.  I spotted an opportunity in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill and moved an amendment to outlaw cash payments for scrap metal in March 2012.  I referred again to ACPO\u2019s estimate that the national cost of metal theft was \u00a3770 million, to the 16,000 hours of delays suffered by rail passengers over the past three years caused by the theft of signalling cable, and to other examples of metal theft such as lead from church roofs, manhole covers, telephone wire and works of art.\nNumerous heritage railways wrote to me to say that scores of metal items such as rails, lamps and even a fork-lift truck had been stolen for their scrap value.\n\nI had another press report dated 1 March saying that seven churches were being targeted and robbed every night for the lead on their roofs; and in a new twist Network Rail reports that, in recent signalling cable thefts on the Cotswold line between Oxford and Worcester, the theft of a 650-volt distribution cable had been concealed by the insertion of a short length of domestic cable in its place\u2014an incredibly dangerous manoeuvre. \n\nThe Government accepted the principle of my amendment, but for reasons which I never understood proposed an exemption for itinerant sellers. That meant that the sale of metal to an itinerant collector will not have to be recorded, whether it is a householder getting rid of some unwanted domestic appliance or a metal thief using the itinerant as a way of getting into the chain. I warned at the time that by proposing that exemption, the Government were opening up a serious loophole that could undermine much of the benefit that their move towards cashless transactions will create. \n\nI said to the Minister that the itinerant seller exemption had alarmed many in the industry. For example, SITA said this in its briefing:\n \n\u201cThere is no reason why a cashless system cannot be implemented by bona fide itinerant collectors, along with the rest of the scrap metal industry \u2026 Moreover, the requirement for a cashless transaction between the itinerant collector and a scrap metal merchant will in any event necessitate the former to maintain a bank account with provision for electronic or cheque payment. It is therefore illogical to exempt the initial transaction between the seller and the itinerant collector, but to (rightly) mandate a cashless transaction for the on-sale of the material to a scrap metal dealer. Traceability over the entire chain, from seller to intermediary to dealer, will be broken along with proof of provenance of the metal presented for sale\u201d.\n\nFortunately that exemption did not last long as later in 2012 we had an entirely new piece of legislation to consider \u2013 the Scrap Metal Dealers Bill.  That was necessary because, as Alchemy Metals said in a briefing to me:\n\n\u201cthe 1964 Act \u2026 is abundantly unfit for purpose. The removal of loopholes such as the Itinerant Trader and Motor Salvage Operator exemption must now pass to law as a matter of urgency. This, combined with further police powers and a comprehensive registration system will give the relevant authorities and the scrap industry itself the powers needed to combat metal theft once and for all\u201d.\n\nFor reasons which I never understood, ministers decided that this would be a private member\u2019s, rather than a government bill, which meant that it was at risk of ambush from a handful of MPs who either disliked the principle of changing the law by a private member\u2019s bill, or didn\u2019t like some of the provisions in it \u2013 or both.\n\nWe were right to be worried because that is exactly what happened.  In the Commons it only takes a handful of MPs to talk out a bill, and that is what they tried with the Scrap Metal Dealers Bill.  In the end they were only bought off by a commitment by the government that they would add what\u2019s called a \u201csunset clause\u201d as an amendment when it reached the Lords.  Had that gone through it would have meant that the Act would have expired after five years \u2013 a completely crazy proposition, given that metal theft was never going to disappear, however effective the Act and equally, the commitment to enforcement.\n\nWhen the bill came to committee stage in the Lords a minister \u2013 it was Lord Attlee \u2013 duly tabled the sunset clause amendment.  I had received many representations how unwise this was.  There was also the procedural point that if the bill was amended in the \u2013 Lords it would have to go back to the Commons, where it would again be at the mercy of the awkward squad who might this time kill it off altogether.\n\nI led the charge against the government amendment, saying: \n\n\u201cI am aware that the Minister in another place gave a commitment to give this House the opportunity to consider the addition of a sunset clause\u2014not to improve the Bill, but in order to buy off the two Members who habitually cause trouble for Private Members\u2019 Bills. The noble Earl has fulfilled that commitment by moving that amendment this morning. It does mean that the House is obliged to accept it.\u201d\n\nUnusually for a Friday, I decided to call a division, and won by 89 votes to 31.  That meant that the bill left the Lords unamended, didn\u2019t have to go back to the Commons, and passed into law.\n\nI would have liked to be able to say this morning that the passage of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act solved all the problems of metal theft.  But we know it didn\u2019t.  During the bill\u2019s second reading I put a question to the Minister on Operation Tornado. I pointed out that its funding and that for the taskforce were due to come to an end in March 2013.  Did the Government intend that this would be renewed, at least until the provisions of the Bill were fully implemented? The danger was that if the funding stopped, police forces would start to focus on other priorities, and the momentum that they have gained would peter out. I said I could not believe that that is what the Government wanted to see happen.\n\nIt gives me no pleasure to say \u201cI told you so\u201d, but those fears were wholly justified, and that I suspect is the main reason you are holding this webinar today.  In Parliament we still have much to do, and we have re-formed the All Party-Parliamentary Group on Metal, Stone and Heritage Crime.  We would really appreciate your help in attracting MPs to join the APPG, and we\u2019ll do our best to give the campaign our best shot.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"], "sections": "\n\n\n\n\n 18th May 2021: Lord Faulkner of Worcester:\n\n\n\nHere is the transcript of my webinair with regards to metal theft affecting the rail services. \n\n  \nLadies and gentlemen,\n  \nThank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you this morning about how Parliament has responded to the scourge of metal theft, and the need to regulate and license the scrap metal trade.\n  \nFor me, this has been a long journey.

In the end they were only bought off by a commitment by the government that they would add what\u2019s called a \u201csunset clause\u201d as an amendment when it reached the Lords.  Had that gone through it would have meant that the Act would have expired after five years \u2013 a completely crazy proposition, given that metal theft was never going to disappear, however effective the Act and equally, the commitment to enforcement.\n\nWhen the bill came to committee stage in the Lords a minister \u2013 it was Lord Attlee \u2013 duly tabled the sunset clause amendment.  I had received many representations how unwise this was.  There was also the procedural point that if the bill was amended in the \u2013 Lords it would have to go back to the Commons, where it would again be at the mercy of the awkward squad who might this time kill it off altogether.\n\nI led the charge against the government amendment, saying: \n\n\u201cI am aware that the Minister in another place gave a commitment to give this House the opportunity to consider the addition of a sunset clause\u2014not to improve the Bill, but in order to buy off the two Members who habitually cause trouble for Private Members\u2019 Bills. The noble Earl has fulfilled that commitment by moving that amendment this morning. It does mean that the House is obliged to accept it.\u201d\n\nUnusually for a Friday, I decided to call a division, and won by 89 votes to 31.  That meant that the bill left the Lords unamended, didn\u2019t have to go back to the Commons, and passed into law.\n\nI would have liked to be able to say this morning that the passage of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act solved all the problems of metal theft.  But we know it didn\u2019t.  During the bill\u2019s second reading I put a question to the Minister on Operation Tornado. I pointed out that its funding and that for the taskforce were due to come to an end in March 2013.  Did the Government intend that this would be renewed, at least until the provisions of the Bill were fully implemented? The danger was that if the funding stopped, police forces would start to focus on other priorities, and the momentum that they have gained would peter out. I said I could not believe that that is what the Government wanted to see happen.\n\nIt gives me no pleasure to say \u201cI told you so\u201d, but those fears were wholly justified, and that I suspect is the main reason you are holding this webinar today.  In Parliament we still have much to do, and we have re-formed the All Party-Parliamentary Group on Metal, Stone and Heritage Crime.  We would really appreciate your help in attracting MPs to join the APPG, and we\u2019ll do our best to give the campaign our best shot.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "site": "", "sourceLink": "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingdecember2020", "sourceSection": "Total police recorded crime decreased by 8% to approximately 5.6 million offences", "offence_type_map": "Overall Police Recorded Crime", "quality": "3.

NVDRS collects information on up to 600 variables per victim, including detailed information on injury characteristics; demographics of victims and suspects; circumstances that precipitated the incident (including those specific to homicides); victim toxicology records; mental health of victims and suspects; weapons used to inflict the fatal injury; characteristics of firearms used to inflict the fatal injuries; and the number of victims, suspects, and manners of death (e.g., homicide, suicide, legal intervention) within incidents. Further, unlike media-based data sources, NVDRS uses de-identified information from official investigative reports and is ideal for comparing mass homicides versus a representative pool of all other homicide incidents due to the scope of the system."], "sections": "Multi-victim homicides are a persistent public health problem confronting the United States. Previous research shows that homicide rates in the U.S. are approximately seven times higher than those of other high-income countries, driven by firearm homicide rates that are 25 times higher; 31% of public mass shootings in the world also occur in the U.S.. The purpose of this analysis is to examine the characteristics of mass, multiple, and single homicides to help identify prevention points that may lead to a reduction in different types of homicides.\nWe used all available years (2003\u20132017) and U.S. states/jurisdictions (35 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico) included in CDC\u2019s National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), a public health surveillance system which combines death certificate, coroner/medical examiner, and law enforcement reports into victim- and incident-level data on violent deaths.

Mass homicides (4+ victims), multiple homicides (2-3 victims) and single homicides were analyzed to assess group differences using Chi-square tests with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons.\nMass homicides more often had female, child, and non-Hispanic white victims than other homicide types. Compared with victims of other homicide types, victims of mass homicides were more often killed by strangers or someone else they did not know well, or by family members. More than a third were related to intimate partner violence. Approximately one-third of mass homicide perpetrators had suicidal thoughts/behaviors noted in the time leading up to the incident. Multi-victim homicides were more often perpetrated with semi-automatic firearms than single homicides. When accounting for nonfatally shot victims, over 4 times as many incidents could have resulted in mass homicide.\nNVDRS has a number of unique advantages as a data source for information about multi-victim homicides in comparison with other federal databases. For example, although CDC\u2019s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) captures nationwide information about deaths due to homicide, its information is derived completely from death certificates, and there is no way to link individual deaths that occurred in the same incident. The FBI\u2018s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) gather additional details for homicides such as the age, sex, race, and ethnicity of both the victim and the offender, the weapon used in the homicide, the circumstances surrounding the offense, and the relationship of the victim to the offender as part of its Uniform Crime Reporting Program, while the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) collects information about the number of victims in an incident and basic information about weapon types and victim-offender relationships; however, the reporting for both is voluntary and not all states and jurisdictions participate.\nIn contrast, NVDRS now collects nationwide data (although fully national data were not available at the time of the study) and participating states can easily identify multi-victim incidents since multiple types of investigative reports provide data, and the level of detail collected in the system about these incidents greatly surpasses that of NVSS, SHR, or NIBRS. NVDRS collects information on up to 600 variables per victim, including detailed information on injury characteristics; demographics of victims and suspects; circumstances that precipitated the incident (including those specific to homicides); victim toxicology records; mental health of victims and suspects; weapons used to inflict the fatal injury; characteristics of firearms used to inflict the fatal injuries; and the number of victims, suspects, and manners of death (e.g., homicide, suicide, legal intervention) within incidents. Further, unlike media-based data sources, NVDRS uses de-identified information from official investigative reports and is ideal for comparing mass homicides versus a representative pool of all other homicide incidents due to the scope of the system.\nThis analysis was conducted using two NVDRS datasets: One was the standard NVDRS Restricted Access Database file, which captures case-level data on all variables in NVDRS. The other was an incident-level dataset developed by the authors specifically to consolidate information about incidents with more than one homicide. The incident-level dataset consolidates all information about incident characteristics, circumstances, and suspects for the incident into one case so that information such as precipitating circumstances and suspect demographics will not be overrepresented in the data as they would if repeated for each victim. This avoids over-weighting incidents with high victim counts when comparing incidents with one another.", "site": "BioMed Central", "sourceLink": "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2021", "sourceSection": "the number of homicides decreased by 16% to 600 offences", "offence_type_map": "Homicide", "quality": "3.

The annual cost per prisoner rose significantly during the war, from \u00a330 in 1914 to \u00a356 in 1917, due largely to increasing costs in clothing, fuel and provisions.151 In England and Wales the total cost of victualling all local prisons rose from \u00a377,279 in 1916 to \u00a3137,503 by the end of the war.152 There were also problems with staff shortages; 41 superior officers, 53 clerks and 824 subordinate officers enlisted by 1918, with no new subordinate staff being hired since 1915.153 Some prisons were even handed over for military purposes in an effort to economize. The prisons at Devizes, Hereford and Chelmsford were used by the army as Detention Barracks, while naval prisoners were held at Lewes.154 Other sites appropriated for this purpose included Bodmin, Brecon, Cambridge, Knutsford, Lancaster, Reading, Ruthin, St. Albans, Stafford, Wakefield and Warwick.155 Similar initiatives were also taken in Scotland and Ireland with several institutions being repurposed for the duration of the war.156 The prison authorities may well have believed that they were reforming their charges, but it is difficult to ignore the clear economic advantages to allowing prisoners to enlist. Indeed, during the war prisons across Britain increased their economic activity to unprecedented levels.\nThroughout the war, prisoners were engaged in valuable war work rather than the usual unproductive forms of convict labour, the framework for war production having been put in place by pre-war penal reforms.

At Aylesbury Prison, England\u2019s main female institution, the inmates voluntarily produced various garments for wounded men, with the governor commenting that they appreciated the opportunity to contribute as many had relatives in the forces.164 In Scotland the women of the Jessiefield Institution used their evenings to knit socks and mufflers for soldiers and sailors.165 Watson has noted that despite the value of \u2018comforts\u2019 made by civilian women, their motivations were often questioned. A common accusation was that their labour could be better deployed, and that their real intention was to gain access to soldiers for purposes that could only be inferred.166 These accusations could hardly be made of female prisoners, for whom producing knitted goods and other comforts was their only means of contributing to the war effort.", "site": "Oxford Academic", "sourceLink": "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingdecember2020", "sourceSection": "Comparing October to December 2020 with the same period the previous year, total offences were 9% lower (1.4 million)", "offence_type_map": "Overall Police Recorded Crime", "quality": "3.
